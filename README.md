- Note that you will need to download essential data files from <link to OSF> in order to run the scripts. 

Here I provide scripts to run InferCNV and classification models on three datasets: GOSH (PD46693), Dong (T200, T214, T69, T230), and Mouse (NB831, NB837, NB839, NB847, NB849, NB853, NB856, NB883). 

The scripts perform on sample basis, results were saved to Output folder.
